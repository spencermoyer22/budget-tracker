# Budget Tracker

## Description
For the budget tracker app, I was responsible for turning it into a Progressive Web Application. To do this I installed IndexedDb that would keep track of tramsactions made when the user is offline and upload them into the MongoDB when the application is returned to oinline status. I also had to install service workers to cache the files from the public folder in order for the app to still be used offline. The last feature I added was a manifest file that allows the app to be downloaded as an application to your device.

## Built With
- JavaScript
- MongoDB
- IndexedDb
- Service-Workers API
- manifest.json
